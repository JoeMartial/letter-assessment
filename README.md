# Marking up a letter

You will markup a letter to test your HTML text formatting skills.

## Starting point

To download the starter files, visit https://github.com/antosan/iwbp and click on the "Clone or download" button and choose "Download ZIP".

You are provided with two files: `text.txt` that contains the raw text that needs to be marked up and `css.txt` that contains the CSS you need to include in your HTML.

You are required to create a new `index.html` file using your text editor to do your work in.

NOTE: You don't need to know any CSS at this moment; you just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.

## Instructions

For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.

### Block/structural semantics:

-   You should structure the overall document with an appropriate structure including doctype, and `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` elements.
-   The letter in general should be marked up with a structure of paragraphs and headings, with the exception of the below points. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.
-   The semester start dates, study subjects and exotic dances should be marked up using an appropriate list type.
-   The two addresses should be put inside `<address>` elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.

### Inline semantics:

-   The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") should be marked up with strong importance.
-   The four dates in the document should be given appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.
-   The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value of "sender-column"; the CSS you'll add later will then cause these to be right aligned, as should be the case in a classic letter layout.
-   The five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter should be marked up to provide expansions of each acronym/abbreviation.
-   The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately â€” in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power or 3 and 4, respectively).
-   Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.
-   There are two places where a hyperlink should be added; add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, just use http://example.com.
-   The university motto quote and citation should be marked up with appropriate elements.

### The head of the document:

-   The character set of the document should be specified as utf-8 using an appropriate meta tag.
-   The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.
-   The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.

## Example

The following screenshot shows an example of what the letter might look like after being marked up.
